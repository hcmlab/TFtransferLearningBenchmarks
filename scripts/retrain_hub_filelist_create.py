    """Builds a list of training images from the file system.

    Analyzes the sub folders in the image directory, splits them into stable
    training, testing, and validation sets, and returns a data structure
    describing the lists of images for each label and their paths.

    Args:
      image_dir: String path to a folder containing subfolders of images.
      testing_percentage: Integer percentage of the images to reserve for tests.
      validation_percentage: Integer percentage of images reserved for validation.

    Returns:
      An OrderedDict containing an entry for each label subfolder, with images
      split into training, testing, and validation sets within each label.
      The order of items defines the class indices.
